## Deep dive (Sonar)

### disaster

### Key Developments
- **Flooding in Central Java**: In Jepara, 6,783 residents and 3,009 hectares of rice fields affected by hydrometeorological disasters (Media Indonesia). In Kudus, dozens of schools flooded, leading to closures and online learning (CNN Indonesia).
- **Ongoing Jakarta Floods**: 11 RTs (neighborhood units) still submerged, with thousands evacuated (CNN Indonesia). Government initiates weather modification to prevent further flooding (detik.com).
- **Sumatera Disasters**: North Sumatera allocates Rp 430 billion for recovery (Tempo Bisnis); government plans renovations for nurses' homes impacted (Tempo Nasional); volunteers ready to assist as flight prices normalize (Media Indonesia). Aksikampus initiative proposed for recovery efforts (Tempo Tekno).
- **Other Incidents**: Tapeng (Tapteng) disaster victims claim eviction from shelters; local government responds (detik.com). Fact-check debunks viral AI-edited Mount Semeru eruption video (Tempo English).
- **Weather Alerts**: Bibit siklon 91W raises risks of heavy rain and strong winds in multiple areas (detik.com). Flood potential persists in coastal regions until February 5 (detik.com).

### Controversies and Political Angles
- **PDIP Criticism**: Opposition party urges government to improve disaster management and strengthen tech-based mitigation (Media Indonesia).
- **Victim Eviction Claims**: Tapteng evacuees allege being forced out of shelters, prompting official rebuttal (detik.com).

### Framing Differences
- **Media Indonesia**: Emphasizes political calls for systemic fixes (PDIP demand) alongside human impacts (Jepara stats) and positive volunteer responses (Sumatera aid).
- **CNN Indonesia**: Focuses on immediate disruptions like school closures and evacuations, highlighting public suffering without political spin.
- **detik.com**: Practical and alert-oriented, covering weather forecasts, government actions (cloud seeding), and local disputes (evictions) with official quotes.
- **Tempo Outlets**: Varied—English version debunks misinformation; others detail budgets, aid plans, and fact-checks, framing as proactive governance amid challenges.

Multiple YouTube videos (e.g., QgdAYk6Ezfg, 4E6ouUm42vk) likely provide raw footage of floods, evacuations, and weather events in affected areas, reinforcing visual scale of Java/Sumatera crises.

**Narrative Summary**: Indonesia faces widespread hydrometeorological disasters as of January 13, 2026, with floods submerging Jakarta neighborhoods, crippling Central Java agriculture and schools, and prompting Rp 430B recovery in North Sumatera alongside aid for health workers. Political pressure mounts for better management, while weather alerts signal prolonged risks from Cyclone 91W; outlets differ in emphasis—activist critiques vs. governmental responses—but all underscore urgent human and economic tolls, debunking viral fakes like the Semeru video.
