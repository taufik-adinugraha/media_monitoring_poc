## Deep dive (Sonar)

### national_politics

### Key Developments
- **KPK Arrests High-Profile Local Leaders**: Komisi Pemberantasan Korupsi (KPK) conducted OTT (Operation Tangkap Tangan) operations arresting Bupati Pati and Wali Kota Madiun Maidi on January 20, 2026. Articles frame this as a stern warning (peringatan) and hard slap (tamparan keras) to regional heads, emphasizing anti-corruption enforcement amid ongoing graft concerns.
  - Wali Kota Madiun Maidi's disclosed assets: Rp 16.9 billion (Kompas Properti), highlighting wealth scrutiny in corruption probes.
- **Copyright Law Draft**: Draf RUU Hak Cipta mandates minimum 25% royalty payments upfront before exploitation, aiming to protect creators but sparking debate on implementation.
- **Iran-US Tensions**: Anticipation of worst-case scenarios from escalating Iran-US conflict, with Indonesia monitoring geopolitical risks (no direct national politics tie, but framed in nasional context).

### Framing Differences
- Kompas Nasional portrays KPK actions as proactive deterrence ("peringatan bagi kepala daerah" and "tamparan keras"), using alarmist language to underscore systemic corruption risks.
- Kompas Properti focuses factually on Maidi's assets (Rp 16.9 miliar), linking wealth to probe without editorializing, contrasting nasional's broader warning tone.
- Copyright and Iran articles are neutral policy/geopolitical updates, lacking controversy.

### Narrative Summary
Indonesia's national politics spotlighted KPK's aggressive anti-corruption moves with OTT arrests of Bupati Pati and Wali Kota Madiun Maidi (assets: Rp 16.9B), framed across Kompas outlets as a critical alert to local leaders amid graft patterns. Parallel developments include a copyright bill enforcing 25% upfront royalties and vigilance on Iran-US flare-ups, signaling regulatory tightening and global risk awareness.

### PR Recommendations
- **Crisis Monitoring**: Advise clients in regional government to audit assets and transactions immediately, preparing transparency statements to preempt KPK scrutiny—emphasize "proactive compliance" framing.
- **Stakeholder Messaging**: For media/creators, highlight RUU Hak Cipta benefits (e.g., "25% royalty protection") in advocacy campaigns to build public support.
- **Reputational Defense**: Develop rapid-response templates for officials, positioning KPK actions as "isolated lessons" rather than systemic indictments to mitigate contagion effects.
